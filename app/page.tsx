          Eat at a local resturant tonight. Get the cream sauce. Have a cold

          think may have nothing in common with you. Order the steak rare. Eat
          an oyster. <em>Be open to a world</em> where you may not understand or
          agree with the person next to you, but have a drink with them anyways.
          Eat slowly. Tip your server. Check in on your [family and] and
          friends. Check in on yourself. <em>Enjoy the ride.</em>
