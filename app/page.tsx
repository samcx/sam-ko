          Eat at a local resturant tonight. Get the cream sauce. Have a cold pint
          at 4 o&apos;clock in a mostly empty bar. Go somewhere you&apos;ve never
          been. Listen to someone you think may have nothing in common with you.
          Order the steak rare. Eat an oyster. Be open to a world where you may
          not understand or agree with the person next to you, but have a drink
          with them anyways. Eat slowly. Tip your server. Check in on your [family
          and] and friends. Check in on yourself. Enjoy the ride.
